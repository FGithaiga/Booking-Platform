                <h3>Do I have to book an appointment?</h3>
                <p>Walk-ins are welcome, but kindly note that we accommodate them by availability.
                    We encourage bookings at least a day prior so that we don’t disappoint in case there are long queues.
                    Call/Text /WhatsApp 0792003986 to book your appointments
                    Ps. Kindly note that we take bookings very seriously. If you run late by more than 15 minutes you will have to book another appointment or wait for the next available technician if there is any on that day.</p>
                <h3>I wasn’t satisfied with my Service, what should I do?</h3>
                <p>We are extremely sorry we didn’t provide the level of service you should always expect at LNP. Our customer satisfaction track record is one of the things we pride in and we wouldn’t want it any other way. But on the rare occasion, something goes wrong we want to hear about it so we can make things right. Kindly let our front desk know what didn’t go right for you or Call/Text/Whatsapp 0780187367.</p>
                <h3>I am confused and don’t know what to do on my nails</h3>
                <p>Being confused is good☺ that’s why we are here. We just don’t jump into working on the nails we examine the nails first then advise on the most appropriate service. The consultation fee is on our tab☺</p>
                <h3>My nails are damaged what do I do?</h3>
                <p>We treat damaged nails but the best thing would be us seeing the nails first, that way we would be in a better position to advise.
                    Please note that we don’t work on infected nails, for that we advise you to see a doctor.</p>
                <h3>After how long should I come for infills?</h3>
                <p>This depends on how fast one’s nails grow but generally 2-3 weeks</p>
                <h3>What are Overlays?</h3>
                <p>Overlays are a protective layer -could be Gel nail, Acrylic , Acrygel or any other desired nail system applied directly on the natural nails to prevent breakage. Overlays can also be applied to toenails.</p>
                <h3>What’s the difference between Acrylic Nails, Gel Nails and Stickons?</h3>
                <P>For Acrylic Nails, an artificial nail tip is fixed and then a layer of acrylic liquid and powder is applied on top. For Gel Nails, an artificial nail tip is fixed and then a layer of hard gel (the thick liquid) is applied then cured under UV light. For stickons, instead of fixing the artificial nail tip halfway the nail plate, it’s glued up to the cuticle line. Stickons can’t be refilled as Acrylic and Gel nails.</P>
                <h3>What mode of payment do you accept?</h3>
                <p>Cash, Mpesa and all Cards</p>
